# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in React

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React, allowing players to take turns, track game history, and revisit past moves. The project is Dockerized, making it easy to set up and run in a consistent environment.

## üõ† Features
- **Interactive Game Board**: A 3x3 grid where players take turns clicking to place their 'X' or 'O'.
- **Game Status**: Displays the current player or the winner when the game ends.
- **Game History**: Tracks every move, allowing players to view and "jump" to previous steps of the game.
- **Winner Determination**: Built-in logic to determine the winner of the game.
- **Dockerized Setup**: Easily run the app in a containerized environment using Docker.

## üéÆ Functionalities
### 1. **Gameplay**
   - A 3x3 grid that alternates between 'X' and 'O' as players click on the squares.
   - Displays the current player‚Äôs turn and announces the winner once the game is complete.

### 2. **Game History**
   - Tracks each move in a history array, allowing users to view the sequence of moves.
   - Players can "jump" to any previous move, letting them see the board's state at that point.

### 3. **Winner Determination**
   - Includes logic to identify a winner based on predefined winning line combinations (rows, columns, diagonals).
   - Displays the winner when one is found, or announces the next player's turn.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your machine.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) if you want to run the app locally without Docker.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amineenim/TicTacToe-Game.git
   cd TicTacToe-Game/

   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image**
   ```bash
   docker build -t react-tictactoe-app .
   ```

3. **Run the Docker Container**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 react-tictactoe-app
   ```
